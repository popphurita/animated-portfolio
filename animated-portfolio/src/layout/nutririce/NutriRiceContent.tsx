            <p>The outcome from the quantitative research with the farmers we found issues with chemical farming and continuous loan for insect pesticides. There is a need to move out of chemical farming and begin organic farming. The transition required many steps including land planning, production planning, and sale planning. To help the transition we are required to look into how we can sell the rice with more value and more impact.</p>

            <p>We continue the research to find customer segment and customer needs for organic rice. We found out that in our target group customers are eating mixed nutrient rice with white Jasmin rice to get more nutrients. This helps with fibre and vitamins. However, customers needed to buy various types of rice from various places before mixing it themselves. Organic rice is also really difficult to find in all the piles of rice in the supermarket.</p>

            <p>As a result, we have delivered an e-commerce application, NutriRice, that allows customers to order all various types of rice from one place, allow customers to mix the rice, and create a set of mixed rice with specific nutrients for different needs. Customers also get to explore and share their recipe within the NutriRice community.</p>
