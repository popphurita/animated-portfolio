# animated-portfolio

I have created this public project as a part of my first year Hacktoberfest. Here is the quick Figma prototype of the animated portfolio I want to implement. I am aiming for only making the landing page first. Then later on will add onto the specific pages. 

In the cards where there are cards with class name "unique content" I want to be able to add some simple animations representing each topic. I want to implement some JS to make the animation move when users hover on it. That way the page has more life to it but at the same time not too chaotic. I am using GIFs as placeholder for the moment. 

Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions!
